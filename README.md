This project was developed for the course "Computer Methods for Business Management" at the University of Milano-Bicocca (Unimib).
The goal was to implement different types of Recommendation Systems using Amazon product reviews datasets.
The project was carried out up to the advanced level, including:
Collaborative Filtering (KNN-based, Matrix Factorization)
Content-Based Recommendation (using textual features processed with NLP techniques, TF-IDF and Transformers embeddings)
Sentiment Analysis on user reviews with classification algorithms
We then analyzed the results and compared the performance of the different approaches.
